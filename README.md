Test for Codigo del Sur

## Issues
- Missing horizontal Scroll view for movieDetails and peopleDetails: I didn't manage to find a solution to this requirement.
- Missing constraints: I understand how constraints work but still there are some parts of the screen where the objects never end up where they were supposed to.
I think I still have to work on that in order to place the objects where I want.
- Missing API call: As you can see there is a library with a function which makes an API call to get extra information about the movies it actually works ,
but I could not achieve to reload the view in the callback of the function. I understand this is probably there is some key concept on swift that I am missing in
terms of reloading.
